# Custom Package

Due to the increasing security levels being applied in the new Unitree package updates (1.1.2-1.1.4), a new method has been introduced. This method essentially replaces the modified files in the filesystem. It will also allow for effective downgrades in future Unitree firmware versions. Custom packages come with pre-enabled secondary development and therefore do not require any manipulation beyond installation.

## Starting the process
To install a custom package, simply follow the instructions in the [go2_firmware_tools](https://github.com/legion1581/go2_firmware_tools/tree/1.1.1-1.1.4) ```(branch 1.1.1-1.1.4)``` repository and select Firmware.
