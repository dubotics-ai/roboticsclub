# What are we?

Robotics Club is a Brazilian open-source initiative dedicated to helping and teaching communities and small groups how to work with their robots and learn more about integration with Industry 4.0.

## Introduction

In this guide, we will teach you step-by-step (as we are authorized) how to handle, hack, disassemble, and create for your robots, regardless of the company or technology they use.
For this, we have created an interactive open-source environment with cloud AI integrations, allowing you to test freely and learn through our guides.

## Caution

We are not officially affiliated with any robot suppliers, and our guides are intended for personal use only, whether for study or practice, with no responsibility for any damage caused.
